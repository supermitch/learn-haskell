-- Introduction

{-
Haskell is a purely functional programming language
Haskell is lazy

Think of a program as a series of transformations on data.

Haskell is statically typed, and has type inference.

Invoke interactive mode via: $ ghci
Load a module (myfunctions.hs) via > :l myfunctions
:r to reload the module.
